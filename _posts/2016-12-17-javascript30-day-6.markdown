The above demo is from today's tutorial of Wes Bos' awesome [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) series. We went over the Fetch API and explored "arrow functions" and "spread", which are making me ready to take ES6 because they seem to be pretty helpful. I also spent a lot of the day watching some of the React courses and redesigning this blog, including adding in a Gulp build process with Browser Sync and Sass. Definitely feeling the coldness of winter setting in, so there was quite a bit of "inside time" to be had. 

I plan to explore Fetch again soon, but it will be something I primarily only keep an eye on, until there is better browser support. Unless there is a way to polyfill? I'm sure there is. Yep just googled it and [there is a polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch). Ok, will revisit this for sure. 

Either way, just glad to have some nicer fonts on here!
