Look at this blog, it's so new! And shiny! A lone wolf exploring the wilderness! A single rider peering over the vast frontier! An eager traveler opening the door to a new journey! A.. voice... echoing into the hum of digital space to everybody and also... nobody... at all! A small contribution of bytes on a... whirring machine that lives thousands of miles away... which, probably has some cheeto dust on it.

Hmm.

I guess it's none of those things. It's just new. 

As romanticized as I'd like to make it in my head, it's just a blog. And sure, it can be exciting and full of promise and aspiration, but it can't take itself too seriously. How could it when this first post is sitting here all alone? How is it going to feel until there is a second one? Will this first post even be read? Do I need a dozen or a hundred before the first entry - a self proclomation - has any context? Does it matter if the point of this whole thing is so that I can simply have a dedicated place to _write_?

It doesn't matter, really. The point is, I love to write and I need to do it regularly. I've had blogs in the past but haven't taken regular time in over 5 years to write, journal, blog or scribble on napkins - and I miss it. If I don't create an outlet to write in some way, then the tendency becomes to ramble - in life, in my head, in email and then again in my head. I'm the kind of person that will analyze and re-analyze and often the only way to sort out the day to day is to process it through words. So, here is the first post and I'm just going to put it out there, with zero expectations. 

In fact, if I had to outline a single goal for this site, it would be to: _maintain a dedicated space where I can reflect on what I'm learning, what I'm doing and what I'm thiking_. I re-wrote that line bunch of times and ended up going broad. I want to spend the next several posts documenting my journey through [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/), but may eventually talk about [my band](http://nephilimchicago.bandcamp.com) or my [company](http://devnext.com) or even some new projects I'm working on. 

I'm excited. I want to see what the effects of having a regular space like this will look like on a personal level. If you're interested in following along, I'd love to have you!
