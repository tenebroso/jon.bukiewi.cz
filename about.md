Hey, there. Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Jon Bukiewicz and I grew up building things on the web. I strive to find solutions by leveraging over 15 years of experience in front end development, project management, user-centric design and communication.

When not coding, I love to lift weights, enjoy too much coffee and spend time with my wife and two kids.
