Hey, my name is Jon Bukiewicz and I've been playing bass guitar for over 15 years. 

I started out in bands throughout high school, switching back and forth between bass and guitar. I've played in roughly 6 different bands, ranging in style from indie to punk to instrumental to folk. I have experience playing in venues of all sizes, from basements to auditoriums and clubs.

In 2016, I joined a metal band called "Nephilim" and recorded bass lines for all of the tracks on Discipline, their debut album.

I have since moved on in order to pursue something less extreme, stylistically. I am currently looking to join an established band as a bass player. Some style influences include Fugazi, Shellac, Pedro the Lion, Metz, Cloud Nothings, Chance the Rapper, Don Caballero and more.

I am reliable, have a great ear for melody, strong sense of rhythm, own a car and pro gear.
